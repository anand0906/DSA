## Strongly Connected Graph

### Definition
A **strongly connected graph** is a directed graph where there exists a path from every vertex to every other vertex. In other words, for any two vertices u and v, there must be a directed path from u to v AND a directed path from v to u.

### Key Properties
- Every vertex can reach every other vertex
- The entire graph forms one single strongly connected component
- If you can traverse from any vertex and return to it while visiting all other vertices, the graph is strongly connected

### Visual Example

```
Strongly Connected Graph:
    A → B
    ↑   ↓
    D ← C

Paths exist:
A→B→C→D→A (main cycle)
A→B, A→C, A→D, B→A, B→C, B→D, C→A, C→B, C→D, D→A, D→B, D→C
```

```
NOT Strongly Connected Graph:
    A → B → C
        ↓
        D

Missing paths: B→A, C→A, C→B, D→A, D→B, D→C (among others)
No way to return to earlier vertices
```

---

## Strongly Connected Components

### Definition
A **Strongly Connected Component (SCC)** is a maximal set of vertices in a directed graph such that:
1. Every vertex in the component can reach every other vertex in the same component
2. No vertex outside the component can be added while maintaining the strongly connected property

### Key Characteristics
- **Maximal**: You cannot add any more vertices to an SCC without breaking the strongly connected property
- **Partition**: SCCs partition the vertices of a directed graph (every vertex belongs to exactly one SCC)
- **Single Vertex**: An isolated vertex (or vertex with no incoming/outgoing edges within its component) forms its own SCC

### Visual Example

```
Graph with Multiple SCCs:

    SCC1: {A, B}     SCC2: {C}     SCC3: {D, E}
    
    A → B  →  C  →  D → E
    ↑   ↓           ↑   ↓
    └───┘           └───┘
    
    - SCC1: A and B form a cycle (A→B→A)
    - SCC2: C is alone (can't reach back to A,B and can't be reached from D,E)  
    - SCC3: D and E form a cycle (D→E→D)
```

---

## SCC in Directed vs Undirected Graphs

### Directed Graphs
- SCCs are the main concept we work with
- Direction of edges matters critically
- A graph can have multiple SCCs
- Each SCC is a maximal strongly connected subgraph

```
Directed Graph Example:
    1 → 2 → 3
    ↑       ↓
    6 ← 5 ← 4

SCCs: {1,2,3,4,5,6} - This forms ONE SCC because:
1→2→3→4→5→6→1 (cycle exists)
```

### Undirected Graphs
- In undirected graphs, the concept becomes **Connected Components**
- Every edge can be traversed in both directions
- If there's a path between two vertices, they're in the same connected component
- Each connected component in an undirected graph would be an SCC if we consider each undirected edge as two directed edges

```
Undirected Graph Example:
    1—2—3    7—8
    |   |    |
    6—5—4    9

Connected Components: {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {7,8,9}
If converted to directed: each edge becomes two directed edges
```

## Brute Force Solution using Floyd-Warshall

### Algorithm Overview
Floyd-Warshall finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. We can use it to check strong connectivity by verifying if every vertex can reach every other vertex.

### Steps for SCC Detection using Floyd-Warshall

1. **Create Reachability Matrix**: Use Floyd-Warshall to find if vertex i can reach vertex j
2. **Check Strong Connectivity**: A graph is strongly connected if distance[i][j] != float('inf') for all pairs (i,j)
3. **Find SCCs**: Group vertices that can reach each other

### Algorithm Implementation Logic

```
1. Initialize reachability matrix with direct edges
2. Apply Floyd-Warshall to find transitive closure
3. For each vertex pair (i,j):
   - If reachability[i][j] AND reachability[j][i] are not equal to infinity,
     then i and j are in the same SCC
4. Group vertices into SCCs based on mutual reachability
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(V³) where V is number of vertices
- **Space**: O(V²) for reachability matrix
- **Not optimal** for large graphs (better algorithms exist like Tarjan's or Kosaraju's)

## Graph Transpose and SCC Behavior

### What is Graph Transpose?
The **transpose of a directed graph G** (denoted as G^T) is obtained by reversing the direction of all edges.

```
Original Graph G:        Transpose G^T:
    A → B                   A ← B
    ↓   ↓                   ↑   ↑
    D ← C                   D → C
```

### Key Properties of Transpose

1. **Same SCCs**: G and G^T have exactly the same strongly connected components
2. **Reversed Edges**: Only edge directions are reversed, not the connectivity within SCCs
3. **SCC Structure Preserved**: The internal structure of each SCC remains the same

### Why SCCs Remain Same in Transpose?

**Proof by Logic**:
- If vertices u and v are in the same SCC in G:
  - There exists path u → v in G
  - There exists path v → u in G
- In G^T:
  - Path u → v in G becomes v → u in G^T
  - Path v → u in G becomes u → v in G^T
  - So u and v can still reach each other in G^T
  - Therefore, they remain in the same SCC

### Visual Example of Transpose Effect

```
Original Graph:
    A → B → C
    ↑       ↓
    E ← D ←─┘
    
SCC: {A,B,C,D,E} - All vertices form one cycle: A→B→C→D→E→A

Transpose Graph:
    A ← B ← C
    ↓       ↑
    E → D →─┘
    
SCC: {A,B,C,D,E} - Same vertices, cycle becomes: A→E→D→C→B→A

The SCC structure is preserved!
```

### Applications of Transpose in SCC Algorithms

**Kosaraju's Algorithm** uses this property:
1. Perform DFS on original graph to get finish times
2. Create transpose graph
3. Perform DFS on transpose in decreasing order of finish times
4. Each DFS tree in step 3 gives one SCC

---

## Visual Examples

### Example 1: Simple SCC

```
Graph:
    1 → 2
    ↑   ↓
    4 ← 3

Analysis:
- Path 1→2→3→4→1 exists
- All vertices can reach all others
- This is ONE SCC: {1,2,3,4}
```

### Example 2: Multiple SCCs

```
Graph:
    1 → 2 → 3 → 7 → 8
    ↑       ↓   ↑   ↓
    6 ← 5 ← 4   10← 9

Analysis:
SCC1: {1,2,3,4,5,6} - cycle: 1→2→3→4→5→6→1
SCC2: {7,8,9,10} - cycle: 7→8→9→10→7
```

### Example 3: Linear Chain

```
Graph: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Analysis:
- No vertex can reach back to previous vertices
- Each vertex forms its own SCC
- SCCs: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Strongly Connected Graph**: Every vertex can reach every other vertex
2. **SCC**: Maximal strongly connected subgraph
3. **Direction Matters**: Only applies to directed graphs
4. **Floyd-Warshall Approach**: O(V³) brute force method using reachability
5. **Transpose Property**: G and G^T have identical SCCs
6. **Practical Applications**: Social networks, web page ranking, circuit design

### When to Use Each Approach

- **Floyd-Warshall**: Small graphs, when you also need shortest paths
- **Tarjan's Algorithm**: O(V+E), single pass, optimal for most cases
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm**: O(V+E), easy to understand, uses transpose property

# Kosaraju's algorithm

## Problem Description

Given a directed graph with V vertices (numbered 0 to V-1) and its adjacency list, find the number of **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**. An SCC is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex within that set through directed edges.

## Examples

### Input
```
V = 5
Adj = [[2,3], [0], [1], [4], []]
```
<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-PnLIld6k" />
### Output
```
3
```

### Explanation
The graph has 3 strongly connected components: {0,1,2}, {3}, and {4}. Within the first component, you can reach any vertex from any other vertex.

### Input
```
V = 8  
Adj = [[1], [2], [0,3], [4], [5,7], [6], [4,7], []]
```
<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-o_TbPDq_" />
### Output
```
4
```

### Explanation
Four strongly connected components exist in this graph.

## Solution

Use **Kosaraju's Algorithm**: a two-pass DFS approach that first determines finishing order, then performs DFS on the transposed graph to count SCCs.

## Intuition

### The Core Problem: Why Simple DFS Fails

```
Original Graph Visualization:
    SCC1          SCC2          SCC3
  ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
  │ 0 → 1   │──→│ 3 → 4   │──→│ 6 → 7   │
  │ ↑   ↓   │   │ ↑   ↓   │   │ ↑   ↓   │
  │ 3 ← 2   │   │ 6 ← 5   │   │ 9 ← 8   │
  └─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘

Problem: Starting DFS from node 0 visits ALL nodes across all SCCs!
We can't distinguish where one SCC ends and another begins.
```

### The Brilliant Solution: Reverse the Graph!

```
Key Insight: If we reverse ALL edges, SCCs remain the same, 
but we can no longer "leak" from one SCC to another!

Transposed (Reversed) Graph:
    SCC1          SCC2          SCC3
  ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
  │ 0 ← 1   │←──│ 3 ← 4   │←──│ 6 ← 7   │
  │ ↓   ↑   │   │ ↓   ↑   │   │ ↓   ↑   │
  │ 3 → 2   │   │ 6 → 5   │   │ 9 → 8   │
  └─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘

Now: Starting DFS from any node only visits its own SCC!
Number of DFS calls = Number of SCCs
```

### But Wait! Which Node Should We Start From?

```
Problem: If we start DFS randomly on transposed graph, 
we might start from the "wrong" SCC and miss others.

Example: Starting from SCC3 in transposed graph won't reach SCC1 or SCC2!

Solution: Start from the SCC that finishes LAST in original graph
(because it will be topologically "first" in the transpose)
```

### The Magic of Finishing Times

```
Why Finishing Times Matter:

In original graph: DFS explores SCCs in topological order
SCC1 → SCC2 → SCC3 (following forward edges)

Finishing order: Nodes in SCC3 finish first, then SCC2, then SCC1
Stack after DFS: [SCC1_nodes..., SCC2_nodes..., SCC3_nodes...]
                  ↑ (top)                                    ↑ (bottom)
                Last to finish                         First to finish

In transposed graph: We need reverse topological order
Start with SCC1 (finished last), then SCC2, then SCC3

Stack gives us perfect order: Pop from top → SCC1, SCC2, SCC3 ✓
```

### Step-by-Step Visual Walkthrough

```
Original Graph Example:
0 → 1 → 2 → 0 (SCC1: {0,1,2})
2 → 3 → 4     (SCC2: {3,4} - but 4→3 missing, so separate SCCs)
4 → (end)     (SCC3: {4})

Step 1: First DFS on Original Graph
Start from 0: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
Finishing order: 4 finishes first, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 0
Stack: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (top to bottom)

Step 2: Create Transposed Graph  
0 ← 1 ← 2 ← 0 (still SCC1: {0,1,2})
2 ← 3 ← 4     (connections reversed)

Step 3: Second DFS on Transposed Graph
Pop 0 from stack: DFS from 0 visits {0,1,2} → SCC count = 1
Pop 1 from stack: Already visited → skip
Pop 2 from stack: Already visited → skip  
Pop 3 from stack: DFS from 3 visits {3} → SCC count = 2
Pop 4 from stack: DFS from 4 visits {4} → SCC count = 3

Final Answer: 3 SCCs
```

### Why This Algorithm is Genius

```
🔍 First DFS: "Survey the landscape"
   - Discovers the topological structure
   - Finishing times tell us the "exit order" from SCCs
   - Stack preserves reverse topological order

🔄 Transpose: "Reverse the flow"  
   - Same SCCs, but no inter-SCC leakage
   - Each SCC becomes isolated island

🎯 Second DFS: "Count the islands"
   - Process SCCs in correct order (reverse topological)
   - Each DFS call = one complete SCC
   - No cross-contamination between SCCs

It's like exploring a river system:
1. First, follow downstream to map all tributaries
2. Reverse the water flow  
3. Start from sources and count separate watersheds!
```

## Approach Steps

1. **First DFS on Original Graph**:
   - Perform DFS to get finishing times of all vertices
   - Push vertices to stack when their DFS completes
   - Stack will contain vertices in reverse finishing order

2. **Create Transposed Graph**:
   - Reverse all edges in the original graph
   - If original had edge u→v, transpose has v→u

3. **Second DFS on Transposed Graph**:
   - Pop vertices from stack one by one
   - For each unvisited vertex, start new DFS
   - Each new DFS call represents one SCC
   - Count the number of DFS calls

        return scc_count
```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**
- **First DFS**: O(V + E) to traverse all vertices and edges
- **Transpose creation**: O(E) to reverse all edges  
- **Second DFS**: O(V + E) to traverse transposed graph
- **Overall**: O(V + E) - highly efficient!

### Space Complexity: **O(V + E)**
- **Original graph storage**: O(V + E)
- **Transposed graph storage**: O(V + E)
- **Stack for finishing order**: O(V)
- **Visited arrays**: O(V)
- **Recursion stack**: O(V) in worst case

### Simplified Explanation
- **Time**: We visit each vertex and edge exactly twice - once in each DFS phase. Like reading a book twice - first to understand the plot, second to appreciate the details.
- **Space**: We need to store both the original and reversed versions of the graph, plus some bookkeeping arrays. Like keeping both the original map and its mirror image.

# Real-World Use Cases of Kosaraju's Algorithm

Kosaraju's Algorithm is used to find **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)** in a directed graph. SCCs are subsets of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in that subset. This concept has many **practical, real-world applications**:

---

## 1. **Deadlock Detection in Operating Systems**

* In resource allocation graphs (used in OS), processes and resources are represented as nodes, and edges denote requests/assignments.
* A **deadlock** occurs if a group of processes is waiting on each other in a cycle.
* Detecting SCCs helps identify such cycles efficiently.
* **Use case:** Preventing system freeze due to deadlocks.

---

## 2. **Web Crawling and Search Engines**

* The internet can be represented as a directed graph: web pages are nodes, and hyperlinks are edges.
* SCCs help identify clusters of websites that heavily reference each other.
* Search engines can:

  * Detect communities of interest.
  * Optimize crawling.
  * Improve ranking algorithms like **PageRank**.

---

## 3. **Social Network Analysis**

---

## 9. **Software Package Management**

* In package managers (like npm, pip), packages are nodes and dependencies are edges.

* Identify **clusters**.
* Optimize **processing order**.
* Improve **robustness** of systems.

# Kosaraju's Algorithm - Why DFS, Reverse, and DFS Again?

Kosaraju’s Algorithm is used to find **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)** in a directed graph.

A **Strongly Connected Component (SCC)** is a subgraph where every node is reachable from every other node in the same subgraph.

The algorithm works in three main steps:

1. **DFS to record finishing times**
2. **Reverse the graph**
3. **DFS in the order of decreasing finishing times**

Let’s break this down with intuition, reasoning, and examples.

---

## Step 1: DFS to Record Finishing Times

* We first do a **DFS traversal** on the original graph.
* The important part is the **finishing time** (when a node’s DFS call is completed).
* We push nodes into a stack (or list) when they finish.

👉 Why?

* The finishing time ensures that we process **the right components first** when we move to the reversed graph.
* A node that finishes last is the one that does **not depend on any other node outside its component**.

📌 Example:

```
Graph:
1 → 2 → 3
↑       ↓
└───────4
```

* If we run DFS:

  * Start at 1 → visit 2 → visit 3 → visit 4 → backtrack.
  * Finishing order: \[2, 4, 3, 1]
* Here, node `1` finishes last, meaning it should be processed first in the reversed graph.

---

## Step 2: Reverse the Graph

* We reverse the direction of every edge in the graph.
* If the original graph has `u → v`, the reversed graph has `v → u`.

👉 Why?

* In the original graph, DFS follows outward edges, so finishing times tell us which node leads strongly connected groups.
* In the reversed graph, DFS now explores **inward connections**, which allows us to capture the entire SCC.

📌 Example (reversing the above graph):

```
Original:    Reversed:
1 → 2        2 → 1
2 → 3        3 → 2
3 → 4        4 → 3
4 → 1        1 → 4
```

* Notice: The reversed graph still keeps the cycle, but DFS starting in the right order will now reveal SCCs directly.

---

## Step 3: DFS in Decreasing Finishing Time Order

* Now we pop nodes from the stack (based on finishing time order from Step 1).
* For each unvisited node, perform DFS in the **reversed graph**.
* Every DFS call will give exactly **one SCC**.

👉 Why?

* Because the reversed graph ensures we can only reach nodes **inside the same SCC**.
* Processing nodes in the order of finishing time ensures that we discover larger SCCs first, and we never miss one.

📌 Continuing Example:

* Finishing order from Step 1: \[2, 4, 3, 1]
* Start with `1` in reversed graph → DFS gives SCC = {1, 2, 3, 4}
* No other nodes left.
* Answer: one SCC = {1, 2, 3, 4}

---

## Different Cases

### Case 1: Multiple SCCs

```
Graph:
1 → 2 → 3
↑         ↓
└── 4 ←───

5 → 6
```

* SCCs: {1,2,3,4} and {5,6}
* Step 1: DFS gives finishing order: \[2,3,4,1,6,5]
* Step 2: Reverse edges.
* Step 3: DFS on reversed graph in finishing order:

  * Start 5 → {5,6}
  * Start 1 → {1,2,3,4}
* Answer: Two SCCs found.

### Case 2: Single SCC (all connected)

```
Graph:
1 → 2 → 3 → 1
```

* All nodes form one SCC.
* Any DFS in reversed graph will capture all nodes at once.

### Case 3: Completely Disconnected Graph

```
Graph:
1     2     3
```

* Each node is its own SCC.
* Algorithm correctly identifies {1}, {2}, {3}.

---

## Summary (Why the Three Steps?)

1. **DFS first (finishing times):**

   * Helps identify a correct processing order.
   * Nodes that finish last are “roots” of SCCs.

2. **Reverse graph:**

   * Changes direction so that DFS explores entire SCCs instead of moving out of them.

3. **DFS again in finishing order:**

   * Ensures we capture SCCs one by one without overlap.

💡 Intuition:

* Step 1 tells us the order to consider nodes.
* Step 2 makes sure that we don’t escape the SCC.
* Step 3 extracts SCCs cleanly.

Thus, Kosaraju’s algorithm is essentially: **Finish times → Reverse → Extract SCCs.**

# Bridges in graph / Targan's Algorithm
# Problem Description

Given an undirected connected graph with V vertices and E edges, find all **bridges** in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph (i.e., disconnects the graph or makes some vertices unreachable from others).

## Examples

### Input
```
V = 4
edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,0], [1,3]]
```

<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-kfpw3bZG" />

### Output
```
[[1,3]]
```

### Explanation
The edge [1,3] is a bridge because removing it splits the graph into two components: {0,1,2} and {3}. All other edges are part of cycles and can be removed without disconnecting the graph.

### Input
```
V = 3
edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,0]]
```
<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-xysZGNeR" />
### Output
```
[]
```

### Explanation
This graph forms a triangle (3-cycle). No edge is a bridge because removing any edge still leaves the graph connected through the other two edges.

## Solution

Use **Tarjan's Algorithm**: a DFS-based approach that tracks discovery times and lowest reachable times to identify bridges in O(V+E) time.

## Intuition

### The Core Insight: What Makes an Edge a Bridge?

```
Key Principle: An edge (u,v) is a bridge if and only if there's NO alternative path 
between u and v that doesn't use this edge.

In other words: If removing edge (u,v) isolates v (and its subtree) from u,
then (u,v) is a bridge.
```

### Visual Understanding: Bridge vs Non-Bridge

```
Case 1: Bridge Edge
    0---1---3
        |
        2

Edge (1,3) is a bridge because:
- Removing it isolates node 3
- No alternative path exists from {0,1,2} to {3}

Case 2: Non-Bridge Edge  
    0---1---3
    |   |   |
    2---+---4

Edge (1,3) is NOT a bridge because:
- Alternative path exists: 1→0→2→4→3
- Removing (1,3) doesn't disconnect the graph
```

### The Brilliant Tarjan's Algorithm Concept

Tarjan's algorithm tracks two crucial timestamps for each node during DFS:

```
1. Discovery Time (tin[v]): When node v was first visited in DFS
2. Low Time (low[v]): Earliest discovered node reachable from v's subtree

Bridge Condition: Edge (u,v) is a bridge if low[v] > tin[u]
```

### Why This Condition Works: Deep Dive

```
Understanding low[v] > tin[u]:

If low[v] > tin[u], it means:
- Node v and its entire subtree cannot reach any ancestor of u
- The only way to reach v from u's ancestors is through edge (u,v)
- Therefore, removing (u,v) would disconnect v's subtree from the rest

Visual Example:
    DFS Tree with discovery times:
    
         0 (tin=1)
         |
         1 (tin=2) 
         |
         2 (tin=3)
         |
         3 (tin=4)

If low[3] = 4 and tin[2] = 3:
- low[3] > tin[2] means node 3 cannot reach node 2 or earlier
- Edge (2,3) is a bridge!

If low[3] = 1 and tin[2] = 3:  
- low[3] < tin[2] means node 3 can reach node 0 (discovered at time 1)
- There's a back edge! Edge (2,3) is NOT a bridge
```

### Step-by-Step Algorithm Walkthrough

```
Example Graph:
    0---1---3
        |   
        2   

Step 1: Start DFS from node 0
timer = 1
tin[0] = low[0] = 1
visited[0] = true

Step 2: Visit neighbor 1
timer = 2  
tin[1] = low[1] = 2
visited[1] = true

Step 3: From node 1, visit neighbor 2
timer = 3
tin[2] = low[2] = 3  
visited[2] = true

Step 4: From node 2, check neighbors
- Neighbor 1 is parent, skip
- No other unvisited neighbors
- Return to node 1
- Update: low[1] = min(low[1], low[2]) = min(2, 3) = 2
- Check bridge condition: low[2] > tin[1]? → 3 > 2? → YES!
- Edge (1,2) is a bridge ✓

Step 5: From node 1, visit neighbor 3  
timer = 4
tin[3] = low[3] = 4
visited[3] = true

Step 6: From node 3, check neighbors
- Neighbor 1 is parent, skip  
- Return to node 1
- Update: low[1] = min(low[1], low[3]) = min(2, 4) = 2
- Check bridge condition: low[3] > tin[1]? → 4 > 2? → YES!
- Edge (1,3) is a bridge ✓

Final Result: Bridges = [(1,2), (1,3)]
```

### Handling Back Edges: The Non-Bridge Case

```
Example with Back Edge (no bridges):
    0---1
    |   |  
    2---+

DFS Traversal:
Step 1: Visit 0 (tin[0]=1, low[0]=1)
Step 2: Visit 1 (tin[1]=2, low[1]=2)  
Step 3: Visit 2 (tin[2]=3, low[2]=3)
Step 4: From 2, find neighbor 0 (already visited, not parent)
        This is a BACK EDGE!
        Update: low[2] = min(low[2], tin[0]) = min(3, 1) = 1
Step 5: Return to 1: low[1] = min(low[1], low[2]) = min(2, 1) = 1
        Check: low[2] > tin[1]? → 1 > 2? → NO! 
        Edge (1,2) is NOT a bridge
Step 6: Return to 0: low[0] = min(low[0], low[1]) = min(1, 1) = 1
        Check: low[1] > tin[0]? → 1 > 1? → NO!
        Edge (0,1) is NOT a bridge

Result: No bridges (cycle detected via back edge)
```

### Why Tarjan's Algorithm is Genius

```
🎯 Single DFS Pass: Unlike naive approaches that try removing each edge,
   Tarjan's algorithm finds all bridges in just one DFS traversal!

🧠 Smart Timestamps: The low[] array cleverly tracks reachability without
   explicitly finding all paths.

⚡ Optimal Complexity: O(V+E) time - you can't do better than visiting
   each vertex and edge once!

🔗 Handles All Cases: Automatically distinguishes between:
   - Tree edges (potential bridges)
   - Back edges (cycle indicators, prevent bridges)
   - Cross edges (in directed graphs)

The algorithm essentially asks: "If I remove this edge, can the subtree
still reach the ancestors?" If not, it's a bridge!
```

## Approach Steps

1. **Initialize data structures**:
   - Build adjacency list from edge list
   - Create arrays: `tin[]` (discovery time), `low[]` (lowest reachable time), `visited[]`
   - Initialize timer counter and result list

2. **Start DFS from each unvisited node**:
   - Set discovery and low time for current node
   - Mark as visited and increment timer

3. **For each neighbor of current node**:
   - Skip if neighbor is parent (avoid immediate backtrack)
   - If unvisited: recursively call DFS
   - If visited: update low time (back edge detected)

4. **Check bridge condition after each recursive call**:
   - If `low[neighbor] > tin[current]`, edge is a bridge
   - Add bridge to result list

5. **Update low time**:
   - `low[current] = min(low[current], low[neighbor])`

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**
- **Single DFS traversal**: Each vertex visited exactly once
- **Edge processing**: Each edge examined exactly twice (once from each endpoint)  
- **Bridge checking**: Constant time per edge
- **Overall**: Optimal - cannot do better than visiting each vertex and edge

### Space Complexity: **O(V + E)**
- **Adjacency list**: O(V + E) for storing the graph
- **Arrays**: O(V) for tin[], low[], visited[] arrays
- **Recursion stack**: O(V) in worst case (linear graph)
- **Result storage**: O(E) in worst case (when all edges are bridges)

### Simplified Explanation
- **Time**: We visit each vertex once and examine each edge twice (from both endpoints). Like surveying a road network - you drive each road segment once in each direction to map it completely.
- **Space**: We need to store the road network map, plus some bookkeeping about when we first visited each intersection and the earliest intersection reachable from each location.
